I have a brain.  I can do many things.  There are some things I can do which only a certain few in society can do.  For example I could sew you an outfit, with a hat and bag to match.  BUT what I cannot do and what I have been trying to do, all night, is connect two desktop computers to a router, not to share stuff or play games, but to have more than 2 computers working at the same time and going through the one modem/router, simply use the one cable that enters this house.  I just found out the router I bought is refurbished, so the company will not, in simple terms, just tell me what wire to get, to connect to where.  There is a box, the router box, a black plug into the wall kind of cable, a small yellow cable about 3 feet long and a white 30 foot cable.  Now I know its not a rubick's cube here, but wires just usurp any last vestige of sense and intelligence form my brain and I can be reduced to tears when it comes to this kind of technology, which is bizarre, being as I am not a crier. I don't want to know which one is the ethernet I just wold like to put them in the right hole so it, the 2 computers with the router, work.  That's all. Please someone help me.  You would not be asking me me if I double seamed, triple stitched, basted or serged if I was sewing you an outfit, now would you. Your concern would be that the outfit stays on you and seams don't split./* SOFTLINK COLORS */
