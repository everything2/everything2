## Coverage Goals

### Current (Dec 2025)
- ✅ Perl: 38.9% (mock-based tests working)
- ✅ React: 18.26% (Jest infrastructure ready)

### Short-term Goals (Q1 2026)
- 🎯 Perl: 40% (comprehensive API testing)
- 🎯 React: 60% (component test coverage)

### Long-term Goals (2026)
- 🎯 Perl: 70% (after PSGI migration enables full coverage)
- 🎯 React: 80% (full component coverage)

## How Coverage Works

### Perl Coverage (Devel::Cover)
- **Mock-based tests**: ✅ Coverage tracked successfully
- **Integration tests**: ✅ Coverage tracked for test-loaded modules
- **Request handlers**: ⏳ Limited coverage (mod_perl architecture)
- **Full coverage**: Requires PSGI/Plack migration (Phase 7)

### React Coverage (Jest)
- **Unit tests**: Coverage tracked via Istanbul/NYC
- **Component tests**: @testing-library/react integration
- **Snapshot tests**: Coverage for render paths

## Recent Coverage Changes

Generated automatically during `./docker/devbuild.sh` runs (when not using `--skip-tests`).
