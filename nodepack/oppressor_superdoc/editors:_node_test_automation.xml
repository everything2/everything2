  <doctext>Now available to you in your Epicenter is the Nodetest automation suite located at [Robotic Editor Shack]. These are a series of deep tests that are going to be run every two days to pick through the nodespace to find holes in it. This is a great improvement over the previous administrator tools that did the same thing, because now the results do not cause any lag or do any damage to the new speed we enjoy.  Because of the speed improvement, we can now offer it to the editor base for usage. The results are stored up, and you can pick through them at your leisure.
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tests were chosen because of their brokenness or because of their non-conformance to basic standards here in our database. At the very least, nodes should have hardlinks, softlinks, a valid author, and a valid e2node parent.  Anything that does not have those qualities, I'd consider &quot;broken&quot;, and could use the attention of an editor.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A lot of other items are writeups that have no votes. These are also probably writeups that are not well integrated into the database and could use to be looked at by someone. Don't feel the need to upvote or downvote them, as that is not necessarily the point.  They may just need to be looked at. Basically, the disclaimer is this, you do not need to kill everything on the list.  If it has no links, it may be savable by fixing it. If it's too short (and the only thing in the node, such as the phobias), then it may be well to suggest that someone fill them in.
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are many items that will not require the touch of an editor. There are tests that will automatically repair the nodes, so it is no big deal to fix them. The webster run is a good example of that. E2 will heal itself eventually, every few days.  This is important, as to free a lot of administrators and editors from menial janitorial duties and cleanup of our broken glasses.  It has always been a personal motto to never do something that a script could do easier, and I feel that it applies here.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once you have made a writeup or node pass the test for which it failed, press the &quot;[nodetestpass|Pass this node!]&quot; button (you'll have to be on the specific writeup for it to take effect); if repairing an writeup, you'll need to be on that writeup. The button will remove it from the failed list. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is my hope that this more powerful toolkit will help us keep the database clean and it will empower the editors and administrators with a more vigilant set of eyes for the most obvious problems.  This suite does not obsolete the &quot;repair this writeup&quot; button at all, and may end up pointing out titles and such that may need to be repaired.  If you have a suggestion for a test or how to improve the suite, please feel free to let me know, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thank you for all your hard work.
