  <doctext>Right now it mostly works for browsing. Tabbed browsing mostly works. Sorta. The textview is not properly displaying content until you resize it. Links broke when I implmeneted tabs and I have no idea why. But you can download it and marvel at the pretty icons I stole from chimera...
&lt;p&gt;
Note that the download is source only, see the readme for instructions on compiling and running. You'll need OSX 10.1 or greater with the developer tools installed, it will not compile on 10.0. You may also need the latest dev tools installed (the december 2001 release).
&lt;p&gt;
Also note that anyone with experience with cocoa development is welcome to help out, just drop me a line. I can set up a cvs or something, no need to duplicate effort )</doctext>
