    <key>Auduster</key>
    <value>The biggest badass of the British 17th Century...  England's Thomas Paine, only with a better moustache. A snotty, opinionated fiercely educated revolutionary who personally made life about as difficult for the Roundheads as anyone could hope. Imprisoned, unimprisoned, imprisoned again...  Makes Ben Franklin look like a royalist.  The man deserves a decent writeup.</value>

    <key>Bitriot</key>
    <value>The company that founded Everything/E2. Fell in the dot-com bust, leaving this community as an imprint.  A good writeup will earn a C! and a node audit from me and, considering the subject matter, probably a toehold in E2 lore.</value>
  </vars>
  <vars>
    <key>Clockmaker</key>
    <value>The node is terribly subpar, with the first writeup as of the time of writing consisting of about 50% aggressive falsehood by volume. A good writeup that doesn't talk nonsense about unsubstantiated &#239;&#191;&#189;primordial mythologies&#239;&#191;&#189; will earn a ching, and I can egg you until I get tired of it.</value>

    <value>C!s for the node and the noder alike!</value>

    <key>Glowing Fish</key>
    <value>We should have something: I would prefer a writeup that gave his biography and explained the importance of his works, but just about anything would be good.</value>

    <key>Halspal</key>
    <value>Thoughtful and soulful writeups will earn rare signed first edition copies of Halspal's book [Humane Society] and his infinite favor. See www.nevilshute.org for the starter kit.</value>

    <key>Hazelnut</key>
    <value>A quality writeup on one of the rarest and more sought after pinball machines of all time, with reference to what it is like to play actually in the flesh rather than in emulation, and get a jackpot of GP. For the wizard mode: write about actually owning such a machine, and get a triple super jackpot.</value>

    <value>I'd be happy to send every noder with a good new w/u about Italo Disco a cool mix cd with my favourite (you guessed it) ITALO DISCO!!</value>

    <value>C! guaranteed. I want a scientific explanation please :)</value>

    <value>Not looking for the band, looking for a commentary on the idea that boys are failing in schools, etc. and the counter argument it's because we're feminizing education. In short, there's arguments for and against it being because of a change in the nature of school and work, and another saying it's affirmative action. I'd like a female noder to examine these issues critically.</value>

    <value>Why in the hell is there no writeup for the TV series? If you do a good job, you get a C! from me, and can request which original series Doctor Who story I write up next. I do not just want to hear about [Emma Peel], you must discuss all the main characters who worked with Steed (including boring old Keel). Try this site for starters: [http://theavengers.tv/forever/guide.htm]</value>

    <value>It is absurd that there is a writeup about a skateboarding trick in this Node but nothing on Madonna the singer born Madonna Louise Ciccone .</value>

    <value>It's been hanging so long, and someone should fill it.</value>
  </vars>
  <vars>
    <key>Wuukiee</key>
    <value>It needs a good writeup. I've been meaning to do it myself for years, and have not to this day gotten around to it. Someone do this awesome event justice.</value>

    <value>Such an interesting movie, yet not even a review for it. Review or summary will get you GP. Both make you eligible for a ching. Going above and beyond will be duly noted and rewarded</value>

    <key>avalyn</key>
    <value>This team ought to have a better writeup by now. Give it a go!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reward: A C! for each deserving writeup and a maximum of fifty (50) upvotes of your other stuff.

    <value>Spending time on research on a woman who stalks me in music stores called Shakira and I cannot figure out why she is doing this based on writeups that are existing there now and very worried. Help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A really informative writeup will get you a blessing and a C! from some of my elitist old guard friends. A writeup that helps me with the stalking problem will get you a computer transmitted photograph of me, Berhardt Goats, being kissed by two lesbians.</value>

    <value>Not currently a nodeshell, but easily could be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;It's a sort of a threat, you see[Slartibartfast|.]&lt;/small&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;bad writeup - A good ol'-fashioned sweater-over-head [goon]ing&lt;br&gt; good writeup - weblogged to the [e2hockey] page&lt;br&gt; amazing writeup - upvotes &amp;amp; C!s from the user group&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Contact [Lord Brawl])</value>

    <value>When you steal the mantle of most influential animator from Walt Disney, when they buy your company to get you to save their ailing company, when you've got Hiyao Miyazaki's phone number programmed into your cell, I think you deserve a writeup here.</value>
  </vars>

    <value>Unfinished at the time of the composer's death this moving piece deserves investigation and recognition. A stunning, definitive writeup will be taken to the editorial staff for review and potential endorsement. </value>

    <value>Tallu was, as they say, &quot;mad, bad, and dangerous to know&quot;, but the existing w/u gives us no idea why. She had an interesting history, both because of her family, and as a performer. Make us proud, and not only will you get 300 GP, but a disc containing all her '[The Big Show]' broadcasts still existing. Aside from the kitsch value, it's a great listen into the last gasp of big network radio.</value>

    <value>bad writeup - a &quot;John 3:16&quot; sign pointed in your direction&lt;br /&gt; good writeup - a C! from me and possibly a visit from [Morgana the Kissing Bandit]&lt;br /&gt; amazing writeup - 50 GP and an autographed picture of the [San Diego Chicken]</value>

    <value>I want to know everything about training a sheep dog (also known as working or herding dog), using a sheep or cow dog, on the farm, shearing time, in shows, basically a very, very detailed thing about every aspect of a sheepdog's life. If it is not everything, I'll frown on it. If it has everything, you'll probably get a ching and endless praise. </value>
