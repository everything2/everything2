  <code># Split text up more intelligently. Text outside
# tags or entities is the only text which will
# impact formatting, so this will be
# split. Textinside tags is not visible (and is
# probably an external URL orsome such) and so
# should not be split.
# 
# The text is split into sections beginning with '&lt;'
# or '&gt;'.  Sections beginning with '&lt;' are
# internal to tags, sections beginning with nothing
# or '&gt;' are external to tags.
# 
# External sections are split further into regions
# beginning with '&amp;' or ';'. Those which begin '&amp;'
# are entities and left intact, those which begin
# ';' are the ends of entities and the beginning of
# plain text and are split in the traditional
# fashion. This has the undesirable behaviour that
# text including lots of entities or semicolons may
# not be split, but this is unlikely to be
# encountered much in practice.
# -- [call]

$max ||= 30;
