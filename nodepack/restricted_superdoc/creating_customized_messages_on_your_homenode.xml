  <doctext>Some folks have [custom] messages on their [homenode] (see [rancid_pickle|mine] for an example). Several people have wondered how to do this, so I decided to pass this information along. The original [perl] [script] comes from one of the [Everything FAQ|E2 FAQs] I was updating, so forward your thanks to folks like [Nate], [N-Wing], [JayBonci], [Professor Pi] and the members of the [edev] group.
&lt;p&gt;

The message on my homenode looks like this:
&lt;p&gt;
Rancid_Pickle is extremely impressed with the writeups by &lt;strong&gt;[% linkNode($USER,0,{lastnode_id=&gt;0}); %]&lt;/strong&gt;! 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
Rancid_Pickle is extremely impressed with the writeups by &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;#91;% linkNode&amp;#40;$USER,0,&amp;#123;lastnode_id=&amp;gt;0&amp;#125;&amp;#41;; %&amp;#93;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;!
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The perl code is between the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; [HTML] tags. Try to be reasonable with this little [gimmick], avoid stupid things like &lt;em&gt;I caught (username) having sex with a donkey!&lt;/em&gt; Sometimes it's nice to see your [name] on someones homenode, and for 90% of the users, my homenode message is [accurate].
&lt;p&gt;
Note that this works only for members of the [gods] group.</doctext>
