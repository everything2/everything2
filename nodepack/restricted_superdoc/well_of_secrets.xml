Listen up and listen good. This is circumstantial, but also good information for people to have when tracking trolls. It will do a series of heuristic tests to try and isolate people who are similar to the current user, WITHOUT using IP info.  Currently we only do password comparison, until the other algorithms are ready.  This is very important, and needs to be kept as a State Secret of the highest order. We'll have other account mechanics in the future. Please respect the privacy of others and also realize that you CANNOT tip information that a person has a same or similar password to others.
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Please use your best judgement.  I expect you all will. Just put in a name, and it'll spit back others that compare to it.
