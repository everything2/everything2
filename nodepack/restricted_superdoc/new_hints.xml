  <doctext>How about linking other nodes in your writeup? To link, put &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;
    around a node name: [Brian Eno] creates a link to Brian Eno. Also, you can
    use a pipe (|) to designate a title. [Brian Eno|Master of Sound] links to Brian
    Eno, but looks like this: Master of Sound  
Use the pipe to reduce the number of &lt;b&gt;dead-end links&lt;/b&gt; in your writeups by 
showing one thing and 
pointing to another.  For example:  [fiction|those crazy voices in my head].  

    You don't even need to have nodes created to make links to them, once
    you've linked you can create the nodes simply by clicking on them--
the Everything search will give you a list of
similar choices...use the &lt;b&gt;pipe&lt;/b&gt; to point to these or create a new node!
&lt;p&gt;
You have an unlimited amount of space for your writeup...why so short?  Tell us more!  
Try to include some references or &quot;further reading&quot; through hard-links.</doctext>
