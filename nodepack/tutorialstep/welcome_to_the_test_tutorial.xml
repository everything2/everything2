  <doctext>Welcome to the tutorial demonstration. This is merely to show you exactly how smart we can be when doing these sorts of things.

&lt;center&gt;Don't get too excited. This doesn't do much... yet...&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
These tutorials are meant as an interactive piece of what the user is doing. Since each tutorial section is it's own overlaying superdoc, we can watch what the user is doing and comment on it. We can also do things such as give messages, redirect to other nodes, and suggest that they go visit things, without being in a canned e2 experience.
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We can have a list of steps that require completion, using their $VARS to store information about them.  This will help us to figure out what the users are doing, along with giving general hints as to what certain things are.  They can explore and have this as a guide.
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Also, keep in mind that we can be sneaky and write down what the users are going to, for our records, and use that data to improve this tutorial.
