      &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to [Everything 2].&lt;/b&gt; [E2] is a complicated place, and what 
        you don't know may cause you trouble. You'll be a lot happier if you make 
        a good [first impression], so here are a few tips to help you get off 
        to a good start by avoiding some common [innocent mistake]s made by [new 
        users].&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;[Your First Writeup]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
          &lt;br&gt;
          &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; 
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Before adding a [writeup] to [E2], ask yourself whether others 
                will find it interesting.&lt;/b&gt; If not, you should find something 
                else to write about. You might also want to hesitate before revealing 
                anything intensely personal or potentially embarassing: Hundreds 
                of people will eventually read what you've written. Don't do something 
                you'll regret later on when you run for [Congress].&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Whatever you write about, &lt;b&gt;tell us all about it.&lt;/b&gt; One line 
                isn't enough. We'd like to know more. Don't just tell us that 
                you work at [Bob's House of Botulism]: Tell us where it is, tell 
                us why you work there, tell us what it's like. If you're adding 
                a [writeup] to a node that has a lot of [writeup]s already, read 
                the others first because your idea may have been added by someone 
                before you got there.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; 
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make links.&lt;/b&gt; Some [people here get hostile] if you don't 
                do that, because the whole point is that everything here is linked 
                to other things. It's easy: Just put [square brackets] around 
                words and phrases, like so: &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;dl&gt; 
                &lt;dd&gt;&lt;tt&gt;My job at &amp;#91;McDonald's&amp;#93; is depressing because a 
                  &amp;#91;giant frog&amp;#93; lives in the &amp;#91;fryer&amp;#93;. His name 
                  is Anthony, and he ate three &amp;#91;customer&amp;#93;s just last week. 
                  &amp;#91;Their anguished cries haunt me still&amp;#93;, but I got to 
                  eat their food so it wasn't a total loss. The frog knows all 
                  the words to &quot;&amp;#91;Bohemian Rhapsody&amp;#93;&quot;. He has the voice 
                  of an angel.&lt;/tt&gt; 
              &lt;/dl&gt;
              &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;When the [writeup] is displayed, &quot;McDonald's&quot;, &quot;giant frog&quot;, 
                and the other bracketed text will become links to other [E2] [node]s, 
                like so: [McDonald's], [giant frog].&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; 
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Spelling and grammar count].&lt;/b&gt; You may not agree, but a 
                lot of people here take that stuff seriously and arguing will 
                never change their minds. &lt;b&gt;It is especially important to spell 
                your links correctly,&lt;/b&gt; because if they're misspelled they won't 
                lead anywhere. For example: There is already a node for [McDonald's], 
                but there is no node for &lt;u&gt;MacDonolds&lt;/u&gt;. Nobody likes a broken 
                link that leads nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; 
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Formatting is a good idea].&lt;/b&gt; If you don't know [HTML], 
                you can at least separate your [paragraph]s by putting a &quot;[paragraph] 
                tag&quot; at the beginning of each one: &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt; 
              &lt;dd&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a &amp;#91;paragraph&amp;#93;.&lt;/tt&gt; 
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When the time comes to learn more, you can read [E2 HTML tags 
                  : Quick Start].&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; 
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Read it again before you submit it].&lt;/b&gt; You'll catch a lot 
                of errors that way. If you get into that habit, you'll do much 
                better here. 
          &lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; 
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;[After Your First Writeup]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
          &lt;br&gt;
          &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; 
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Your masterpiece is complete, but nobody seems to care]&lt;/b&gt; 
                or &lt;b&gt;[Your masterpiece is complete and somebody voted it down].&lt;/b&gt; 
                That happens to me, too. You may be angry and feel a need to complain 
                in the [Chatterbox] (that little [chat] thing on the right-hand 
                side of this page), but that's a [bad idea]: [Stoicism] is admired 
                here. You won't make any friends by complaining. &lt;b&gt;Here's what 
                you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; do: [It's okay to ask nicely for help].&lt;/b&gt; If 
                you just say &quot;[I'm not sure what I did wrong]&quot;, people will understand 
                and try to help.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; 
              &lt;p&gt;Maybe &lt;b&gt;[there's a message in the Chatterbox with a checkbox 
                next to it].&lt;/b&gt; When that happens, it's a private message directed 
                to you by another user. Nobody but you can see it. You can reply 
                privately by using the &quot;[/msg]&quot; command in the [Chatterbox]:&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;dd&gt;&lt;tt&gt;/msg wharfinger I swear to God, Mick Jagger was in the Beatles! 
                He really was!&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If you click the [checkbox] before you send your reply, the 
                  message to you will disappear. If the message is a suggestion 
                  or a correction, &lt;b&gt;they're not being mean. They're being helpful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We haven't covered everything, but you don't need to know everything 
        right away. This should be enough to get you started. You should read 
        the [Everything FAQ] too, but [it's more fun to play than to read the 
        instructions]. For more helpful hints, see the [Everything University]. 
        &lt;b&gt;Have fun.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
